For this project there were lots of parts I found very easy and a few parts that just made me bang my head on the table. For the most part, I was able to make adjustments to the css file and work through quite quickly, but other parts I had trouble with.
The main issue I had was getting the octopus to the right side of the octopus quiz section, and although i got it fixed I had to go back into the grid carrot game to actually figure it out. Another big issue I had was margins and borders, not really knowing what to change to make things line up in the way i wanted. The final issue I had which I just couldnt solve was trying to make the text the right size and boldness. I was messing around with this for a long timme and it just never looked right.
